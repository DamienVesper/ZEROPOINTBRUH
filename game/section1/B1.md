## Great
Glad to hear that we like some of the same colors, whatever you choose. I can't Really tell because i've coded this in markdown and i'd have to make a seperate page for ever section but alright.

## Anyway
That was a Warmup Section, to make sure the game was working and not directing you to a dead page. The real game will begin now, it should take no longer then 60 seconds, and should be really easy to awnser. at the end, you will see the credits of who made this game and an invitation to our discord if you feel its nessassary to join. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this game i've created which is but not of a few kilobytes of space to even play, which loads way faster then a flash game from a website that has ads all over it.

If you feel you are ready, just click one of the few options, otherwise, you are safe to close this page.
